<h4>A Brief History of How We Got Here</h4>
<div class="card2">
<p>In the last few years of covid, we like many others were stuck inside watching youtube videos and dreaming of the world we were missing. I started watching a popular show on Netflix ‘The Durrells’ - and as I looked out at the panoramic sea views, menagerie of animals and simple life of the family I felt a change, a calm, that I had needed. It wasn’t quite at this moment that the pieces came together but deep down I knew that I wanted to make a change like that family. To take a leap to live a simple life, somewhere I could see the ocean even if money and opportunities weren’t exactly forthcoming. It may have helped that they too lived in England and I could relate to the grey monotony living through the pandemic.
</p>

<div class="card2">
  <p>We had always been interested in sustainability, the tiny house movement and alternative ways of living. (My love of pirates may have had some subconscious pull on me as well if we’re being totally honest) I wanted to be off the grid, not beholden to a monthly bill from energy providers, tax and all the rest. Still the pieces didn’t quite come together… until I discovered sailing channels. 
  </p>

<div class="card2">
  <p>Our family expanded during covid and two little kittens, Loki and Cleo, came into our lives who had so much heart and personality we can honestly say we’ve never had any other pet like them. They truly are our family. Perhaps the fact that we spent every minute of every day during lockdown together, but these cats express their intimate bonds with us like no other. The fact that human contact was so limited they became very used to an insular environment and afraid of other people and noises outside the home. For a year they were too afraid to go outside athough we slowly but surely got them used to the garden they are still not used to people and prefer to stay indoors and hide when anyone comes to the house. It’s for these reasons that we feel becoming liveaboards and taking them along for the journey will be harmonious for them as all they truly want is to be with us as much as possible (and chatter away at birds which I think the boat life will provide ample opportunity for).

<div class="card2">
  <p>Our holidays always consisted of the beach. I grew up for 5 years in Australia and after snorkelling the Great Barrier Reef as a child my love for the sea was always the most dear aspect of the environment to me. I only wish that everyone could have experienced and appreciated the absolute wonder of the Great Barrier Reef before bleaching, coal companies and global warming decimated one of the greatest wonders of the world. But the truth is I want to see the natural world before it may be too late, to show it to those that never put the pieces together as I was doing through life. That this is something worth changing our habits for and saving as best we can. Our interconnectedness and impact on the world cannot be underestimated.</p>

<div class="card2">
  <p>This blog is our project to inspire others that may be wondering how they can achieve a lifestyle that betters the whole world around them and not just themselves, that feeds the mind and spirit and makes us a balanced part of nature once again. To take back that most precious resource that was abundant in covid and gave us some space to think- time. We want to show you the places where people strive for the welfare of animals, nature and each other to support their efforts and bring some exposure to the great work of these truly inspiring people and places.
