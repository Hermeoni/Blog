  <h3>Our First taste of hands on Sailing</h3>

  <div class="card2">
  <p>The beginning of our journey on the seas! We'll cover the different aspects of competent crew courses here and give you a flavour if you're interested in starting your own sailing adventures.</p>

  <h4>We went with First Class Sailing</h4>
  <div class="card2">

  So a competent crew course is either five days in a row or you can break it up over two weekends. We treated it like a sailing holiday regardless but given our cats sensitivity to anyone other than us we didn't subject them to a long stint without us. I really cannot emphasise enough how much they dislike other people. They’ve even learned to recognise the sound of delivery drivers so they can go to their favourite hiding places long before anyone ever reaches the door. At least we know when the post is coming. That’s Covid era cats for you - they’ve grown up in isolation and apparently would very much like to keep it that way.

<h4>Where we went</h4>

<div class="container6">

</div>

<div class="card2">

  <p>The Solent in the UK is such a busy channel of water that it is a very well respected place to learn. We went to Cowes, Beaulieu, Isle of Wight, Shamrock Quay, Solent. We set off each weekend from Shamrock Quay in the Solent, passing freight liners and under bridges, dodging all the bustling activity of ferries and thrill seekers past the roar of the football stadium. As we came further out we started to become aware of currents, water depth and rites of passage. 

    Our final destination was Beaulieu Marina and we stopped by the Master Builders House Hotel. This place has such interesting local history and is steeped in character. The corridors are full of pictures and antiques, while the fireplace is coveted, surrounded by comfortable couches and the coves are covered in plush pillows.
    We couldn't have asked for a better place as the last night of our journey. We felt enveloped in warmth and comfort as we shared stories of our past and soaked up the history of the boat builders that had boomed here and the intrigues surrounding it.

<h4>The boat and the costs</h4>

  <p>Sezarac 38ft Beneteau

    What you pay for the course is dependent on how many people are on the boat etc. & mooring fees came to £96 which we split between us. Food all provided. You’ll also need to buy a sailing log to get signed off and keep your certificate in, which cost about £7.

<h4>What did we bring</h4>
<div class="card2">
  <p>A sleeping bag and bed sheet was a requirement from First Class Sailing, sailing gloves as well as some boots - or you could buy some from them at the marina. Apparently certain shoes can mark boats so you have to get a special kind. Grip and being waterproof were my chief concerns so we got some very affordable ones from Decathlon and they worked perfectly.

  </p>
</div>

<div class="card2">
  <p>Full wet weather gear, sailing gloves and thermals were my constant companions and they provided us with the former and a lifejacket. I imagine if you’re doing this in summer and not November like we did you may want to have gear for warm weather as well. </p>
</div>


<div class="card2">
  <p>I recommend sunscreen no matter the time of year though. There’s a lot of light being reflected off the water and the wind really beats your face raw so the sunscreen will probably help a bit there as well. Some vaseline on top and you’re as prepared as you're going to be without having some sort of scarf. I rigged a scarf to wrap around the back of my head and tuck into the sides of my cap to protect from the wind as well. Not fashionable but honestly appearance is the last thing on your mind when you’re out in the elements, and what a good distraction they were too. 

  </p>
</div>

<div class="card2">
  <p>One word of warning, be careful about hats- as we found out in a storm that tore apart our sail (see our post on that experience here), it can completely obscure your vision if it becomes waterlogged and stretched down over your eyes. Personally I wore a cap and I found this worked pretty well to keep most of the rain and sun out of my eyes. It didn’t move or become a danger for me, although at times when it was cold I tucked the edges of my scarf under it to protect from the wind and this can somewhat obscure your peripheral vision so you need to be really alert with checking your surroundings (which to be honest in the solent you are doing constantly). The number of yachts, ferries, windsurfers, kayakers and buoys will keep you constantly on lookout.

  </p>
</div>

<div class="card2">
  <p>Something about completely changing your priorities and focusing on the environment around you really makes the break feel like a longer, more peaceful one than a regular getaway. That is, restful and somehow exhausting at the same time. Probably because we were burning 3000-5000 calories per day and listening to strange creaks in the dark.
